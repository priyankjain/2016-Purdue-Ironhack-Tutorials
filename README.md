### Chart Libraries

You'll be creating visualizations as part of Purdue Ironhacks, so knowledge of some javascript charting library would be handy.   
Here are some useful ones:
+ <a href="http://arborjs.org" target="_blank">Arbor.js</a> - A graph visualization library   
+ <a href="http://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> - A library to create interactive graphics and visualizations   
+ <a href="http://c3js.org" target="_blank">C3.js</a> - A library built on top of D3.js which allows you create charts with few lines of code. <a href="./Charts-with-c3js-tutorial.md" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a quick tutorial on c3.js    
+ <a href="http://sigmajs.org" target="_blank">Sigma.js</a> - Another graph visualization library   

### Google Maps Javascript API

Purdue Ironhacks will involve playing with location data, so Google Maps is a recommended feature to have in your project. <a href="./Google-Maps-Tutorial.md" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a quick tutorial on Google Maps API.

### Datasets   

   
The rules require you to use one mandatory dataset [Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web) and one dataset from either [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) or [Open Indy Data Portal](http://data.indy.gov/). You can read more about these datasets here [Datasets.md]   

### Github

You'll be required to use Github.com for submitting your code to our system. <a href="Github-Tutorial.md" target="_blank">Here</a> is our tutorial on getting setup with Github.com for this hack. You can learn advanced git <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git" target="_blank">here</a>.   

### Tutorial Project    

We have made a complete tutorial project along the lines of the problem statement. You can find the tutorial [here](Tutorial Project.md) and demo [here](http://rawgit.com/priyankjain/2016-Purdue-Ironhack-Tutorials/master/2016-Purdue-Ironhacks-Tutorial-Project.html).
